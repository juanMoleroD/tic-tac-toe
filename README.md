# tic-tac-toe
The classic Tic Tac Toe game made in SpringBoot and JavaScript.

All the logic is implemented server side in SpringBoot, with a JS frontend than only handles API calls and updating on screen.

Websocket establishes the connection between the two users for immediate updates when they move and a topic to handle the gameplay.
